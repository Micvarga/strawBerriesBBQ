# Strawberries BBQ Version 1

## About the Project

I created this static web site to act as a digital business card for a family members BBQ business in the Chicago metro area. The site was intended to be used in conjunction with the companies established social media accounts to increase their market presence and help draw in potential clients through a more professional medium.

## What I learned

This was my first personal web development project. It required me to get familiar with the Chrome Developer tools as I strived to make a fully responsive website. I learned the pains of not approaching the project with a mobile first approach which required a lot of re-styling as I tried to scale down to a mobile view. This project gave me the opportunity to practice HTML and CSS fundamentals along with using the Bootstrap 4 grid system. I also got to practice using SASS variables which really helps out when styling for a company or client that already has an established color pallet for their business.
